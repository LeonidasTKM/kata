6 kyu:  Java format Unicode encoder/decoder

We need a reusable program to encode/decode text to unicode value as represented in Java and vice-versa.

Encoder:
Input
"hola"

Output
"\u0068\u006f\u006c\u0061"

Decoder:
Input
"\u0068\u006f\u006c\u0061"

Output
"hola"

Observations:
Please note that unicode values have always a backslash \ the letter u and 4 hexadecimal digits corresponding to the value in the unicode character set.
Codewars has some trouble showing non ASCII characters so perhaps you should try it locally first.
